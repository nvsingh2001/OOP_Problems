# OOP Problems & Solutions

A collection of Java-based Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) exercises and mini-projects. This repository demonstrates core OOP principles such as Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Abstraction through various real-world simulation scenarios.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into separate packages, each addressing a specific problem statement or system simulation.

### Modules

- **ATM Simulation** (`atm`)
  - Simulates basic ATM operations including user authentication and transaction menus.

- **Banking System** (`bankingsystem`)
  - Models a bank with different account types (Savings, Current) using abstract classes and inheritance.

- **Book Management System** (`bookmanagementsystem`)
  - A library system to manage book inventories, allowing users to borrow and return books.

- **Car Simulation** (`carsimulation`)
  - Demonstrates polymorphism by modeling standard Cars versus Electric Cars with distinct behaviors.

- **Custom Array** (`customarray`)
  - A custom implementation of a dynamic array (`MyArray`) using Java Generics to handle various data types.

- **Employee Management System** (`employeemanagementsystem`)
  - Manages employee records and automates promotion logic based on experience levels.

- **Enrollment System** (`enrollmentsystem`)
  - Handles student enrollments in different courses and tracks attendance.

- **Inventory Management System** (`inventorymanagementsystem`)
  - Simulates a warehouse environment, processing orders and managing product stock levels.

- **Music Player** (`musicplayer`)
  - A CLI-based music player capable of playing, pausing, and looping audio tracks (WAV/AIFF) using `javax.sound`.

- **Parking System** (`parkingsystem`)
  - A comprehensive parking lot management system handling different vehicle types (Trucks, Bikes, Cars) and calculating parking fees.

- **Restaurant Menu System** (`restaurant`)
  - A food ordering interface modeling different menu items like Burgers, Pizzas, and Pasta.

- **Shape Calculator** (`shape`)
  - Calculates the area and properties of various geometric shapes (Circle, Rectangle, Triangle).

- **Zoo Simulation** (`zoosimulation`)
  - Simulates a zoo environment where different animals exhibit unique behaviors (eating, sleeping, making sounds).
